Description: Synthesised pipe organ emulator
 Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that
 should be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a
 software synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds
 of controls for each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his
 instrument.
 .
 Main features of the default instrument: three manuals and one pedal,
 five different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course,
 stereo, surround or Ambisonics output, flexible audio controls
 including a large church reverb.
 .
 Aeolus is not very CPU-hungry, and should run without problems on a
 e.g. a 1GHz, 256Mb machine.
