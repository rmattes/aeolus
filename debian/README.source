aeolus for Debian
---------------

  This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
  source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
  debian/patches and applied during the build.

  To read how to properly use quilt, please refer to the official
  documentation available at:

    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source
